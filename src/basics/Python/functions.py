# Here we shall see how to define a function in Python.
# A function definition starts with the keyword 'def':

def func():
    print("No Parameters")
    
def func(param):
    print(param)
    
func(5)

# Unlike OOP languages, Python doesn't support function overloading.
# If multiple definitions of a function exist, the latest definition is taken


# Also, blocks of code in Python are identified by the number of spaces before the lines.
# For example, if 5 consecutive lines have 2 spaces preceeding them, they belong to the same block.
# Each block in Python defines a scope for the variables defined in that block.
