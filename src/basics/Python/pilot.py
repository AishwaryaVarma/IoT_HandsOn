# This is a comment in Python. It starts with a '#' symbol.
# The below line is used to define and initialize a variable:
x = 5

# Unlink other languages, Python variables are not defined with a fixed data type.

# Lets define another variable.
y = 10

# Now, we have two variables. Lets try adding them:
z = x + y

# Finally, print the result:
print(z)
