# Introductions
Here, we address the basic concepts involved in a generic IoT system.
IoT technology consists of three separate technologies:

- Embedded Systems
- Network Technology
- Information Technology.

The system we will be using is a NodeMCU board, which we shall program through the Arduino IDE.

The NodeMCU shall be used as a HTTP client.
We shall code the server ourselves, using the Python programming language.
